        Many loadboards say they're connected with shippers or great brokerages.
        However, at the end they still want to offer loads at under $3 a mile or
        worst! $2 a mile. We can all agree, we've even seen some at .97 cents a
        mile. It's absolutely ridiculous. No More. Our loadboard will ONLY have
        loads that are fair for everyone involved in the supply chain. What
        can't be denied is it's our drivers that is keeping the America's
        moving, and they should not be getting the scraps at the table. A bright
        future is almost here, and we can't wait to show everyone the final
        product!
