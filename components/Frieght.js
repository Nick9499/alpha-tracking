        After being in the business for years, we have noticed theres something
        missing. That THING is TRANSPARENCY. We are on the road 24/7 missing
        family events, birthdays, anniversaries and the majority will be lucky
        if they make $3-$3.50 a mile. No More. We are going to disrupt the
        freight brokerage business. Stick around and see the wild ride we're
        about to take!
