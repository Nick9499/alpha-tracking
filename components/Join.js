        Call today and speak to one of our onboarding representatives and see
        how you can bring your power or trailer over to Alpha! Here at Alpha we
        believe in transparency, including any costs associated with working
        with Alpha. It's simple! 10% for dispatching, after hours support,
        claims support, and more. If you join our authority, it will just be 10%
        for just authority (no force dispatch) and 20% for Authority and all
        dispatch services.
