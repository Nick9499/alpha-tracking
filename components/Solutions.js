            It happens to the best of us! Brokers will hold back funds for the
            most minor situations. However, screaming and cursing them out won’t
            solve anything. You need someone to take a legal approach to
            communication. Our Tier 2 Supervisors are knowledgeable on what it
            takes to handle any situation.
